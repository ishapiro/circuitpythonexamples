# circuitpython examples
Examples of Circuit Python Code for the DrVax community.

The DrVAX YouTube channels teaches people how to make thinks by using the rapidly expanding world of desktop and home manufacturing resources.   While the channel has focused on 3d printing and woodworking the explosion of simgle board computers easily programmed in pythod open the world of electronics to makers with a range of skills.

There are currently two programs in the repository for working with the AdaFruit FeatherS2.

feather_buitton_test.py is a simple program that demonstrates how to use the two programable LEDs on the board and how to attache a button wired to the board as indicated in the diagram "featherS2 Circuit Diagram.png"

feathers2_sma_button implements the "Magic SMS Button" soon to be described in an Instructables tutorial and in a video on the DrVAX YouTube channel. This program is an example of how to build a door bell or panic alarm for a senior with just a couple of components and a few lines of code. This example uses an Adafruit FeatherS2, CircuitPython and Twilio.  The code utilizes the Circuit Python wifi, socketpool and adafruit_requests libraries.
